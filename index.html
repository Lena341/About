       <p>I am a final year student at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Ioannina, in Arta Greece.
        In 2018, I started my studies at the school of Computer Engineering in Arta, Greece. The curriculum included 8 semesters. The first 5 
        semesters included compulsory courses, the 6th and 7th semesters included direction courses and the 8th semester included preperation of bachelor's thesis
        and internship. Among the compulsory courses were courses on Computer, Network and Software Engineering, Web Development and Graphics,
        like Computer Architecture, Analog and Digital Electronics, LAN & MAN Networks, Network Management, Telecomminication Networks, 
        Advanced Interworking Services, Programming in C, C++, Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases and Operating Systems,
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Adobe Photoshop. I chose the Software Engineering direction and some of my courses were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Engineering (grade:5)</li>
            <li>Management Information Systems (grade:6)</li>
            <li>Visual Programming (grade:5)</li>
            <li>Computer Systems Security (grade:9)</li>
            <li>Web Application Technologies (grade:7)</li>
        </ul>
       In 2022, I successfully finished my internship at the Science and Technology Park of Epirus in Ioannina, as well as my bachelor's thesis on
       "Research and comprarison on the public Cloud Computing platforms - Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure" (grade:9.5) which you can read in Greek or English on the Thesis page.
       This final year includes two semesters and the four compulsory courses: 
       <ul>

       </ul>
       Apart from Software Engineering, I like Cloud Computing that is why I take online courses offered by Microsoft Learn and AWS and Web Development so in my free time
       I like making websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
